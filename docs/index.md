# Documentation

The quais.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.

It is often used to create decentralized applications (dapps), wallets (such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Tally](https://tallyho.org)) and other tools and simple scripts that require reading and writing to the blockchain.

## About this documentation?

These docs are still under construction, and are being expanded every day.
