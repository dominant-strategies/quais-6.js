A collection of useful utilities for manipulating data, mathematical operations, and more.

A large number of the available utilities are generally for *internal use and are not intended to be used directly by developers*. However, there are a number of utilities that are useful for developers, such as the `FixedNumber` class, which provides fixed-point arithmetic, and the `EventPayload` class, which provides a way to encode event payloads.

## Classes

|                                                 |                                               |
