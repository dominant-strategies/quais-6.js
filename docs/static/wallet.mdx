When interacting with either Qi or Quai, it is necessary to use a private key authenticate actions by signing a payload.

Wallets are the simplest way to expose the concept of an Externally Owner Account (EOA) or UTXO account as it wraps a private key and supports high-level methods to sign common types of interaction and send transactions.

The class most developers will want to use is Wallet, which can load a private key directly or from any common wallet format.
