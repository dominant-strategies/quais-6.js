Addresses are a fundamental part of interacting with Quai Network. They represent the gloabal identity of Externally Owned Accounts (accounts backed by a private key), contracts, and UTXO wallets.

These functions help convert between various formats, validate addresses across the Quai and Qi address spaces, and other utilities for working with addresses.

The Quais SDK supports the following address formats:

-   `quai` addresses
-   `qi` addresses
