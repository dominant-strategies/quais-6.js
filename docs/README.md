# Quais-6 Documentation using Typedoc

## Generate documentation

To generate docunentation, run the following command:

```bash
npx typedoc
```

This will create the `/docs/content` folder populated with formatted markdown files constructed from JSDoc comments in the source code.

## Output

- **Static Files**: All markdown files in the root `/docs/` directory and the `/docs/basics` and `/docs/cookbook` subdirectories are static files that are not generated by Typedoc.

- **Generated Files**: All markdown files in the `/docs/content` directory are generated by Typedoc.

- **Navigation File**: The `/docs/navigation.json` file is generated by the `typedoc-plugin-navigation-output` plugin.

## Configuration

The Typedoc configuration file,`typedoc.json`, is located at the root of the repository. This file specifies the input and output directories, and the plugins to use. All configuration for the documentation output is located in this file and the referenced `tsconfig.base.json` file.
